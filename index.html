I work as a Researcher in the Cognitive Solutions and Services group at IBM Research, Bangalore, India. I'm interested in designing reliable, distributed, interactive, multi-modal systems involving human computer symbiosis for faster decision-making and task execution.

My recent work involves investigating user-friendly programming abstractions to enable rapid development of reactive, data-driven web applications (user interfaces, in general). I also have expertise in automated verification and theorem proving techniques for checking reliability of sequential/concurrent software systems.

I worked earlier as a Research Staff Member in the System Analysis and Verification group at NEC Labs, Princeton. I obtained my Ph.D. and M.S. in Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, and B.Tech. (Hons.) in Computer Sc. and Engg. from IIT Kharagpur.
