    <h4>
    My recent work involves investigating user-friendly programming abstractions to enable rapid development of reactive, data-driven web applications. Previously, I have worked extensively in automated bug hunting and verification of sequential/concurrent software systems using mathematical modeling, constraint solving and compiler technologies.
